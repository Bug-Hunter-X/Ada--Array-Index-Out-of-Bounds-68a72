# Ada Array Index Out of Bounds Example

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Ada: attempting to access an array element using an index that is outside the valid range of the array. This error results in a `Constraint_Error` exception.

The `bug.ada` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.ada` file shows how to prevent this error by adding input validation.
